Apache OpenEJB is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
sponsored by the Geronimo PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until 
a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making 
process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the 
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
