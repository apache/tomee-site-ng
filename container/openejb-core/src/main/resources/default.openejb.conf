<Container id="Default CMP Container" ctype="CMP_ENTITY">
# This container can service CMP 1.1 and 2.x Entity Beans
#
# Persistence is achived by taking the entity beans deployed
# and internally readapting them to the new EJB 3.0 JPA (Java
# Persistence API) specification.  It is possible, though
# not well documented, to mix in newer JPA concepts with
# old style Entity beans allowing you to slowly transition
# your entities to JPA.  Aggressively inquiring on the
# users@openejb.apache.org about this feature will help
# us generate better documentation.
# ---------

# ConnectorName is he id of the Connector element which
# should provide connectivity for this CMP Container

#  The passivator is responsible for writing beans to disk
#  at passivation time. Different passivators can be used
#  by setting this property to the fully qualified class name
#  of the PassivationStrategy implementation. The passivator
#  is not responsible for invoking any callbacks or other
#  processing, its only responsibly is to write the bean state
#  to disk.

#  Known implementations:
#     org.apache.openejb.core.stateful.RAFPassivater

    Passivator   org.apache.openejb.core.stateful.SimplePassivater

#  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This
#  value is measured in minutes.  A value of 5 would
#  result in a time-out of 5 minutes between invocations.

#  Specifies the size of the bean pools for this

#  Property name that specifies the number of instances

#  Must be less than the PoolSize.

<Container id="Default Stateless Container" ctype="STATELESS">
#  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This
#  value is measured in milliseconds.  A value of 5 would

#  Specifies the size of the bean pools for this

#  StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool
#  reaches it's maximum size and there are incoming requests
#  that need instances.
#
#  With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances
#  to become available.  The pool size will never grow beyond the
#  the set PoolSize value.
#
#  Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary
#  instances to meet demand.  The instances will last for just one
#  method invocation and then are removed.
