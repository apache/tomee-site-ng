  #  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This

  #  result in a time-out of 5 milliseconds between invocations.

  MaxSize  10

  #  StrictPooling tells the container what to do when the pool
  #  reaches it's maximum size and there are incoming requests
  #  that need instances.
  #
  #  With strict pooling, requests will have to wait for instances
  #  to become available.  The pool size will never grow beyond the
  #  the set MaxSize value.
  #
  #  Without strict pooling, the container will create temporary
  #  instances to meet demand.  The instances will last for just one
  #  method invocation and then are removed.
