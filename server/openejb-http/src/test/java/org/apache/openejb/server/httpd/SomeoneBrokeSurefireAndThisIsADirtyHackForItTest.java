/**
 * Surefire hack for running HttpEjbServerTest class via maven.  Not for use in IDEs
 *
 * At some point Surefire decided it wasn't going to run anything that wasn't an
 * immediate subclass of TestCase, even if your parent's parent was TestCase or
 * your class was assignable to TestCase.
 *
 * So this class is a dirty hack to get the HttpEjbServerTest class to run with the build.
 *
 * NOTE: use the HttpEjbServerTest class in your IDE instead of this one.
 *
 * @see HttpEjbServerTest
 * @version $Revision$ $Date$
